# Circle of Friends

## Technologies:
MySql. Javascript/jQuery. HTML/CSS Materialize. Express & Node.js.

## The Why:

Have you ever walked into a store only to be greeted by the same cashier you always see working there? She always remembers you and knows all about your dog, Spot, and kids, Tammy and Lawrence, but you can't even remember her name. With Circle of Friends, you can now store all your favorite people in your favorite locations. Never forget a person again! Add multiple contacts to a specific location. When you visit the pinned location, you can view who you know and start building your circle of friends.

## The future:

What we hope to improve in the coming months is to allow push notifications with who you know when you arrive to a pinned location. Making the app more mobile responsive.
